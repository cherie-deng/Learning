# Learning
Coding practice that isn't part of a bigger project.

## Get Ahead
Code solutions to the technical challenge questions from the Google Get Ahead programme.
  * Question 1: Flattened iterator  
Given a list of iterators, implement a FlattenedIterator class which incrementally iterates over the integers from all the iterators in an interleaved fashion.
  * Question 3: Longest path in tree  
Write a function that computes the length of the longest path of consecutive integers in a tree.
